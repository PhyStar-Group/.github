# 欢迎来到PhyStar开发团队主页 /Welcome to the PhyStar Development Team Homepage

开发团队将对PhyStar程序平台项目进行长期持续开发，目标在五年内（2023-2027年）建成为一个半开源/全开源的复杂多物理场（流场、多相、多组分、流固耦合等）求解程序平台。方便相关领域科学家与爱好者自由开展相关研究。

The development team is committed to the long-term and continuous development of the PhyStar project. The goal is to build a partially open-source/fully open-source to solve complex multiphysics fields (including flow fields, multiphase, multicomponent, fluid-structure interactions, etc.) within five years (2023-2027). This platform aims to facilitate research activities for scientists and enthusiasts in relevant fields.


## 进展/Progress
- 初步实现了简单解析流场/均匀各向同性湍流/槽道湍流中颗粒两相流问题，实现了颗粒的单向/三向耦合过程，目前正在进一步优化颗粒与流体的求解结构。
- Preliminary implementation of particle-laden flows in simple flow, homogeneous isotropic turbulence and turbulent channel flow. Particle couplings, including one-way and three-way coupling, have been implemented. Currently, further optimization of the solution framworks for particles and fluids is in progress.
- 完成点颗粒模型（非球形颗粒，游动颗粒，粘附颗粒），下一步计划丰富求解器类型（谱/差分槽道/边界层求解程序、浸没边界法）和颗粒模型。
- We have implemented point-particle models(non-spherical particles, swimming particles, smart particles). In the next step, we will enrich the fluid solvers (spectral/difference channel/boundary layer, immersed boundary method, and so on) and particle models.
- 发布计划：2023年底实现课题组内测，2024年上半年，同行合作者小范围测试.
- Release plan: Internal testing within the research group by the end of 2023, followed by small-scale testing with peer collaborators in the first half of 2024.
